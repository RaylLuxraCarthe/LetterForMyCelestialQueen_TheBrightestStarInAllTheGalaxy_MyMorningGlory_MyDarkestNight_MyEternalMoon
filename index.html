      <div class="main-text">
      <p>My Dearest Honey,</p>
      <p>No words can describe my everlasting love for you.</p>
      <p>My biromantic honey, the girl who loves light blue, to the one with undiagnosed ADHD.</p>
      <p>Take this letter as a reminder of not of your birthday, nor that of our Anniversary, nor even that of our farewell.</p>
      <p>This letter is a symbol that no occasion is too special to actually be able to give you something.</p>
      <p>I mean don't get me wrong I love our special days together, but... Just so you know.</p>
      <p>I love your birthdays, I love our Anniversary, valentines, christmas, whatever the day it may be.</p>
      <p>I want you to always remember that with you, every single day is special.</p>
      <p>My pingu, my ducky, my catto, my cutie pie in the whole wide world. You're the cutest in the world.</p>
      <p>The sadist who loves control, yet masochistic during certain times and losing control.</p>
      <p>You who've kissed and tried looking for love, yet just not able to get things right.</p>
      <p>The one so strong, yet so fragile, the one so smart, yet so obliviously dumb, the one who I made my everything.</p>
      <p>You whose love chart goes about liking Acts of Service, Quality Time, Physical Touch, Words of Affirmation, and Gift Giving.</p>
      <p>The one who was supposed to be named Crystal Claire, a born Catholic yet Agnostic.</p>
      <p>You who love sweets, mecha anime, and cutesy whoopsy stuff.</p>
      <br>
      <p>That's enough of describing you for now, you get the picture and it's entirety already my lovely honey.</p>
      <p>Just to clarify as well honey you're the only one with access to this, cuz I know how much you like your cutie little secrets and all that.</p>
      <p>One more thing, don't expect something like this from me for a while or ever again, because you're the first and last person who'll ever see this.</p>
      <p>I want it to be. Honey ever since that day with Airalyn, Caryl, Ellyca, Nathalie, and Judith, I've never actually been the same.</p>
      <p>My faults my efforts just reduced to nothing more, but I wanted to do this for you and only you.</p>
      <p>Hoping this is my last, I'm sorry if I'm not the type to show you any effort that much or just do anything that might spark us.</p>
      <p>I'm just broken as we've talked about on and on before. You who deserve the world, My Honey, I guess what I'm trying to say is, be patient with me.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Who knows if this is my first or even my last letter like this, but you know it's fun to keep it like this.</p>
      <p>That's all I'm trying to say, I'll try to make this as detailed and intricate as possible for you.</p>
      <p>As I know you love it so. The question is, where do I even begin</p>
      <br>
      <p>The very first day I met you in that office felt like nothing I'd say the least, you didn't even bat me an eye nor did I try to approach you at I'd like to say the 29th of March 2024.
      I'm not quite sure yet, but is the most logical date to say the least, yet this linger voice in my heart says it was the 15th of March, I just know it was a Friday.
      Tried cross referencing this a couple times already with pictures, but have no data regarding our meeting whatsover, could fact check with Selwyn, but too bothersome.
      Really weird to say for sure, didn't even record our encounter, because I really thought that was a come and go thing.
      Life really is weird if you think about it two people unrelated to one another came about through Selwyn, April, and Shakera for no apparent reason, just a trip down memory lane.
      Then everything faded once again, the blank times of our life, then I reached out to you regarding the event on the 31st of March 2024, where you coldly rejected me.
      Then time passed till nothingess was about, I passed you by you were going down, I was going up the spiral staircase, I tried to greet you, but you just fluttered by unknowingly.     
      It's still etched on my mind, funny how things came to be, I knew 100% that it was you, then I don't know why I just felt sad during the time, then forgot about it again.</p>
      <br>
      <p>11th of June 2024</p>
      <p>Met at the office with Gwen and introduced ourselves properly this time, it was painfully awkward trying to befriend you.
      I just stopped trying so hard not to impress you afterwards, you were painstakingly easy to get along with, yet weird in a sense that I just couldn't say.
      I didn't try to go for you, I just didn't treat you like Nathalie and Judith, I treated you to an extent on how I was with Caryl and Ellyca.
      Then the 14th of June 2024 came by, I was somewhat nervous, can't remember all the details, life these days kinda hazy as I've said before, it's just weird.
      Right that was the time I got my first picture of you, got called a weirdo by Selwyn, heh, didn't even meant anything by it.
      Then the 18th of June 2024, our hangout at Super Daddy with CK trauma bonding and shit like that, then went our separate ways afterwards.
      The beginning as I'd like to call it the 22nd of June 2024, that time when I was making my own art piece for Pride Month, but never got to finish it.
      As I roamed around the school finding stuff for the flag pole then fixing it up at the office, then making my way to the main gate to hoist it up that's when I saw you.
      I remembered that you said you were planning on going to 7/11 that day, you were also one of the first to see caa, it was weird honestly.
      As you then came with me to the office, knowing full well I was a weirdo during the time, like eugh you could've avoided all of this if you really wanted to.
      The car ride we went on to humming bird was fun, yet now a blur to me, I honestly don't know why I even asked you out that day, I can say it was for friendship purposes though.
      You feeling the urge to puke, making you feel so weak and shit like that, I honestly thought you were just making excuses before to get out of the situation you were in.
      As well as the croissant that you still owed me, it's honetly kinda funny if you think about it, I remembered trying to ask that of you and our pinky promise, so that I could see you again.
      Now that I think about it though, those were good memories, it was one of the most wholesome shit I've done with my life thus far, it was sweet.
      Then the day ended, as I thought nothing like that would last...</p>
      <br>
      <p>24th of June 2024</p>
      <p>The day sent me a video of yourself flipping me off for the first time, it was cute and caught me off guard like the fuck is this.
      It sent many signals I couldn't comprehend, it was like you were hitting on me or something, you looked really cute in that video honey, you were kira kira
      It sent many signals I couldn't comprehend, it was like you were hitting on me or something, you looked really cute in that video honey, you were very kira kira.
      Though that was the time itself that I thought to myself this couldn't be, like imagine that honey, I tried reall hard to tread as lightly as I could around you I was scared.
      I didn't want to lose another girl like you in my life. Then the next day came, when we played we the dogs and I thought you'd ignore me during that time cuz you just left without me.
      I felt kinda sad during the time as I just sat their at the lobby as it slowly got dark, it felt lonely.
      Do you still remember that time, when you tolde me my universe was cringe, as I told you, you were the center of it? Weirdo, it did happen, huh?
      Life really is weird honey, now you're that idiot running in my mind rent free, oh right then the day after that you sent the catto with apps.
      Everything about was just fun and weird, I love talking with you on and on, the 30th of June 2024 came by, got another pic of you flipping me off hehe, cutie.
      I'm blind and scared, didn't want to commit with anything, I was just fucking with you, that was my plan, just a friend, or if I did go for you I'd just fuck you.
      I couldn't bring myself to do that doe, you were just too precious to hurt after a while, then when I replied a f u emoji with the crying face, you got sad.
      Weird I didn't know if at the time it was genuine or what, then that fated day came.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The 1st of July 2024</p>
      <p>The day when we met up at the office acting sus and all that, as we made our way to caa as we spotted Carl and Judith.
      That was one of my eugh moments, cuz I thought they'd approach you about me after that day, as we went to Kolon CafÃ©, we got somewhat lost cuz of the GPS,
      As we wandered around getting to know more and more about each other, I swear I wasn't expecting anything out of that day doe, you were also weirdly huddled up with my jacket,
      Everything about that day was just fun though, the talks we had at the restaurant, the pictures I took of you with the strawberry, and the way you chased that catto around.
      Then the frequency of meeting up increased more and more, I started to look for you more and more, the day after that we hung out at Moda Mart, dropping you off home.
      The weird convos we had while going, everything was just a weird experience to say the least.</p>
      <br>
      <p>4th of July 2024</p>
      <p>The morning I read our chat and replied to you like and idiot and cut myself, how stupid was it of me to talk to you while drunk!? AGHHH!
      The night before that though, April was already really suspicious of who I was talking to, imagine during the time I was already balling my eyes out cuz of You, Caryl, and Ellyca.  
      Then that morning cuz of this comically large cut I had, I was worried tried to look around here and there for surgery, but didn't mind it instead, cuz it was too expensive.
      I even told the reason for my cut was a kid swinging a knife around as I was trying to catch it, fuck it was really weird, then when I came to, went to school, forgot what happened honestly.
      Though at around 10:05 you asked me to have lunch together, it was my first time eating at Ti By Ko, hehe everything was weird. Sorry I was late again.
      For our evening date cuz of the foot surgery hehe, now I'm good, who knows till when doe, as I rushed over to school running around limping cuz of my foot.
      Then we drove to Humming Birb, hehe birb, as we talked about our likes, and just weird stuff that I love so much about you.
      We headed out after our meal, as you almost slipped cuz it rained that day, remember? Then inside the car we tried to hold hands, my right your left.
      I also think that was the first time we held each other apart from that time when we were going down from Kolondatal like ahhhhh.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Confession day, the 5th of July 2024</p>
      <p>The day of reckoning. 
        
      </p> 

      
      <p>Each heart-shaped light above mirrors the way your love has lit the vast constellations of my existence.</p>
      <p>You are the moon to my tides, the fate in my signs, the gentle pull of destiny when all else feels adrift.</p>
      <p>This letter is not just a note â€” it is a constellation of thoughts, strung together in the shape of you.</p>
      <p>Even the stars blink slower when I think of your smile. Time pauses â€” not out of fear, but reverence.</p>
      <p>You are my mystery and my map, my storm and my sanctuary. A celestial force I orbit around, willingly lost and joyously found.</p>
      <p>Every heartbeat, a star. Every breath, a galaxy. And every moment I get to love you â€” an entire universe reborn.</p>
      <p>And if someday we forget all else, let this page remain â€” a frozen moment in eternity, where I said what I feel most clearly.</p>
      <p>That I love you â€” not just as a man loves a woman, but as the cosmos loves the void. Without condition. Without end.</p>
